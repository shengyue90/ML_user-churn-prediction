Machine Learning - Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunication Industry
• Developed program for telecommunication service vendors to predict customer churn probability based on labeled data using Python and Spark

• Preprocessed data set by data cleaning, feature transformation, standardization and feature correlation, etc.

• Trained the data using supervised machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNN), and
applied regularization to deal with over-fitting

• Evaluated performance of models using K-fold cross-validation technique

• Analyzed feature importance to identify top significant features on the results
